            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hacking Microsoft SQL Server Without a Password - Anitian Blog</h1><p>During a recent penetration test, I was performing some packet captures and noticed some unencrypted Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) traffic. The syntax was unmistakable. At first I thought this might be a way to capture some authentication credentials. However, MSSQL encrypts login traffic which meant I would have to crack the encryption to get credentials.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/81f994ef9185166681400a4be79c37c1cf8a6104.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hack-proof RFID chips</h1><p>Researchers at MIT and Texas Instruments have developed a new type of radio frequency identification (RFID) chip that is virtually impossible to hack. If such chips were widely adopted, it could mean that an identity thief couldn't steal your credit card number or key card information by sitting next to you at a caf√©, and high-tech burglars couldn't swipe expensive goods from a warehouse and replace them with dummy tags.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6eef12d54bd4c4188aecf87fbc7adb54e315e2c0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
