            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What keeps white hat hackers from turning to the dark side?</h1><p>To protect her identity, let's call her Dee. Dee describes herself as an ethical hacker. She is young, attractive, speaks with an Eastern European accent and has fiery red-purple hair. She reminds me of Mila Jovovich in the sci-fi movie, The Fifth Element. We were eating lunch at the Hack-in-the-Box conference in Amsterdam.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/021dd388fa2fc35d00d31153ad40c4fd994fc2aa.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Worldwide Encryption Products Survey</h1><p>Today I released my worldwide survey of encryption products. The findings of this survey identified 619 entities that sell encryption products.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New Bill Aims to Stop State-Level Decryption Before It Starts</h1><p>Over the last several months, local legislators have embarked on a curious quest to ban encryption at a state level.
