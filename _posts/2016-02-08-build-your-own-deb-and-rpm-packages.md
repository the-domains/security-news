description: "If you count the most prominent and well-known Linux distributions, you'll notice that nearly all of them utilise two software package types: DEB or RPM. The first one comes from the world of Debian and spreads on Ubuntu and dozens of its derivatives, while the RPM, originally created for Red Hat, is used in Fedora, Mageia, OpenSUSE and many others."
