    description: "Google is adding another layer of protection for its cloud computing customers. Starting today, the company will let users hold their own encryption keys for Google Compute Engine, the company's cloud processing platform. Google already encrypts data on the platform, but it manages the keys itself, leading to concern among some that the company could be compelled to decrypt the data without the user's permission."
