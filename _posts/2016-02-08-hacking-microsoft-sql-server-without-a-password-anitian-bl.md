description: 'During a recent penetration test, I was performing some packet captures and noticed some unencrypted Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) traffic. The syntax was unmistakable. At first I thought this might be a way to capture some authentication credentials. However, MSSQL encrypts login traffic which meant I would have to crack the encryption to get credentials.'
